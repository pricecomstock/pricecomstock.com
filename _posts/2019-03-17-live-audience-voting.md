description: a rundown of our first test kitchen show using the live audience voting system

I made a [voting system]({% link _portfolio/1_liveaudiencevoting.markdown %}) designed to let an audience use their smartphones to vote live during a show. I wanted to make it very visible and fun for everyone in the room, so I made a live, physics-based bubble chart where each audience member is represented by an emoji, which moves to different areas as they change their vote.

Anyways, it's easy to see in real time, and is especially fun when you can instantly see the votes changing in reaction to some event. So far, we've used it for a few different shows, all in the Test Kitchen this was built for:

### Horror Movie Genre Improv
In the first scene, we had all the characters introduce themselves. For the rest of the show, the names of the performers in each scene were put up for voting. The character with the most votes had to die. Some takeaways:
* votes would often change if a character said something that would make them unlikeable
* I locked the votes at some point during the scenes, but it would probably be more fun to leave it unlocked and let people get saved by the audience opinion changing right before they get killed

### Dad Joke Battle
We had pairs of performers come up and each tell a dad joke and the audience voted for a winner.
* After the first person told their joke, there would usually be one or two votes for them and several votes against.
* Then the second person would go and people would groan at their joke and some votes would go back to the first person.

### Live Debate

This was a mostly political format debate that we set in a small town with some made-up issues to discuss.
* It could easily be way more or way-less politcally formatted.
* Ours became largely about the characters more than the topics
* I'd probably shorten the rounds (we did 15 minutes I think) and have different people debate different pairs of things.
