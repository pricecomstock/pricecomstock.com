Egg sandwiches are the ideal food. You should eat one every day. I lost a lot of weight and saved a lot of time and money by sticking to this rule as much as possible.

## Eating Healthy is Hard
I'm a nerd. I want there to be an easy (if not necessarily exciting) way to eat healthy.

TODO this could be a big product-comparison style table lol
* Premade Soylent and other meal replacements are cheaper and healthier than dining out, but not all that tasty, and still more expensive than home-cooked meals. Plus you go through a lot of plastic bottles so the environment probably isn't a fan
* Powder mix meal replacements are cheaper and greener than premade, but lose some of the convenience and are still sort of bland.
* Meal prepping at home is a good way to get cheap and tasty meals but I always somehow ended up spending 3.5 hours in the kitchen making ~10 okay breakfast burritos (a whopping 20 minutes per burrito, plus time to microwave them from frozen)! Also sometimes freezing food can sort of make the texture not very good.
* Egg sandwiches are:
  * cheap (TODO calculate these)
  * healthy
  * fast - i can cook one from scratch in 5-7 minutes
  * fresh - you don't have to freeze ingredients ahead of time and all of the important ones last weeks in the fridge
  * tasty as hell - this is subjective but there's something about eggs + cheese that is one of the GOAT flavor combinations to me
