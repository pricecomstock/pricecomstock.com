Inspopaper is a slack app written in Python that adds a message action that allows anyone to create an inspirational wallpaper from any message.

More samples of wallpapers with dummy quotes can be generated on the [landing page](https://inspopaper.fun).

I also [did a writeup](/2019/04/07/generating-wallpapers-for-inspopaper.html) on some of the details of how it works.
