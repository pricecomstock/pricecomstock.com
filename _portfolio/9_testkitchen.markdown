Test Kitchen is a live comedy show I run with Cory Starman in which we come up with a brand new format each month to experiment with different ways to do comedy.

Sometimes the format requires some programming to bring to reality, which is why so many of my projects seem single-use and hastily finished around 7:30 on a Thursday.
