[PowerRank](https://powerrank.pc.codes)

It's a site where you can rank things. The domain powerrank.io was a bit of a meme amongst my friends. I received the domain as a secret santa gift, but the site was real. Eventually it expired and I never renewed it because $45/year is a lot for a site used by zero people. :(

Despite the sad ending, it is one of the more thorough web-apps I've created. It uses a database and has lots of input checking which are things you only do when a project is very important (at least to you SADFACE)

Anyways it looks like the "don't use this for production" free Heroku database integration wasn't kidding, so the site is lightly broken right now!
